This is the repository with the pdf papers on primitive abundant numbers. These files are descriptive only;
all of the code for primitive abundant numbers is in the primab-modules repository.

DISCLAIMER: While all of this is my original work, I am aware that I did not invent the concept.
It is more than likely that at least some of the concepts in these files existed before me. It
is also likely that at least some of the concepts here are my own invention. If nothing else,
the python modules are certainly new.
